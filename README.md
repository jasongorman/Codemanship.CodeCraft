Code Rules for Code Craft Driving Test

This is a prototype tool that will (hopefully) automatically check code for candidates taking the trial Codemanship Code Craft Driving Test on Sept 16th.

It should allow them to automatically check their code whiole they're working on the mini-project for the driving test, so they'll know in advance if it will fail any of our quality checks.

Rules are as follows:

1. Assemblies, types, methods, fields, parameters and variables must have names <= 20 characters.
